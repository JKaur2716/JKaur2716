 # Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
<p>My name is Jaspreet Kaur.</p>
<p>I was born in India, but I have spent most of my life in Canada.
Before coming to Canada, I lived in Spain for a year and learned some Spanish as a kid.</p>
Right now, I am a Post-secondary student at [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca/).
<p>More about that:</p>
