 # Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Jaspreet Kaur**. I was born in India, but I have spent most of my life here, in Canada. 
Before coming to Canada, I lived in Spain for a year and learned some Spanish as a kid. 
Right now, I am a Post-secondary student at SAIT. 
<p>More about that:</p>
- I am a Web Design and Development major at SAIT. This is my first year and I am really excited to finally be in a program that I am passionate about. :smile: 
- I love combining creativity with technical skills, and web development allows me to do just that. I'm passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites that solve real-world problems.
- I am a lifetime learner. I believe in continuous learning, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest trends in web design and development.
